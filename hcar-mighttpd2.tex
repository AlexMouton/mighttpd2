Mighttpd (called mighty) version 3 is a simple but practical Web server in
Haskell. It provides features to handle static files, redirection, CGI,
reverse proxy, reloading configuration files and graceful shutdown. Also TLS
is supported.

The logic to handle static files has been transferred to Warp, an HTTP server
library. So, Mighttpd became a simpler web application now.

You can install Mighttpd 3 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB. Note that the
package name is {\it mighttpd2}, not {\it mighttpd3}, for historical reasons.

Since the last HCAR, Mighttpd provides the Tls\_Chain\_Files configuration option to support certificates generated by Let's encrypt and returns a bad request for paths including dot files for security reasons.

\makeheader

Mighttpd (called mighty) version 3 is a simple but practical Web server in Haskell.
It provides features to handle static files, redirection, CGI, reverse proxy, reloading
configuration files and graceful shutdown. Also TLS is experimentally supported.

Mighttpd 3 is now based on WAI 3.0. It also adopts the auto-update
library to reduce CPU power consumption at no connection.

You can install Mighttpd 3 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB. Note that the package name
is {\it mighttpd2}, not {\it mighttpd3}, for historical reasons.

Mighttpd 3 now supports GHC 7.10.

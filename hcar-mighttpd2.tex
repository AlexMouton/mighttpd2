Mighttpd (called mighty) version 3 is a simple but practical Web server in Haskell.
It provides features to handle static files, redirection, CGI, reverse proxy, reloading
configuration files and graceful shutdown. Also TLS is experimentally supported.

Since Warp supports HTTP/2, Mighttpd 3 is able to serve in HTTP/2 (if TLS is enabled) as well as HTTP/1.1.

You can install Mighttpd 3 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB. Note that the package name
is {\it mighttpd2}, not {\it mighttpd3}, for historical reasons.

Mighttpd (called mighty) version 3 is a simple but practical HTTP1.1/HTTP2 server in Haskell.
It provides features to handle static files, redirection, CGI, reverse proxy, reloading
configuration files and graceful shutdown. Also TLS is supported.

The logic to handle static files has been transferred to Warp, an HTTP server library. So, Mighttpd became a simpler web application now.

You can install Mighttpd 3 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB. Note that the package name
is {\it mighttpd2}, not {\it mighttpd3}, for historical reasons.

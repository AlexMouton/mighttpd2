Mighttpd (called mighty) version 2 is a simple but practical Web server in Haskell.
It is now working on Mew.org serving static files, CGI (mailman and contents search) and reverse proxy for back-end Yesod applications.

Mighttpd is based on Warp providing
performance on par with {\tt nginx}.
You can use the {\tt mightyctl} command to
reload configuration files dynamically and shutdown Mighttpd gracefully.

You can install Mighttpd 2 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB.

Michael Snoyman and I are now working on WAI 2. So far, we improved the performance of Warp much. Mighty version 3 will be based on this new Warp and also provides much faster logger than the fast-logger package.

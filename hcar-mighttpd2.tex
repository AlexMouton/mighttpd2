Mighttpd (called mighty) version 3 is a simple but practical Web server in Haskell.
It provides features to handle static files, redirection, CGI, reverse proxy, reloading configuration files and graceful shutdown. Also TLS is experimentally supported.

Mighttpd 3 is now based on WAI 2.0 or later and uses new {\it warp} and new {\t fast-logger}. This results in much improvement of its peformance if Mighttpd 3 is compiled by GHC 7.8.2 or later.

You can install Mighttpd 3 ({\it mighttpd2}) from HackageDB. Note that the package name is {\it mighttpd2}, not {\it mighttpd3}, for historical reasons
